I am an enthusiastic Data Scienctist with a pasion for Mathematics, Statistic and Machine Learning. I am constantly engaging in real-life projects to develop practical skills, expose my self to new theoretical statistics concepts and gain valuable experiences. My passion lies in leveraging the knowledge I acquire to solve a wide range of problems and provide data-driven solutions in any context.

With a BSc H degree in Mathematics and having successfully completed over five distinct projects, I have developed skills and gained experience that I confidently apply as a Data Scientist. My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge and making a meaningful impact through data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Projects

### [Predicting Customer Satisfaction from Yelp Reviews using NLP](https://github.com/adilsaid64/yelp-reviews)

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether customers are satisfied or not based on the reviews they have written.

**Results:** Learned the basics of Natural Language Processing, applied Count Vectorizer, and utilized Naive Bayes classifiers. The model achieved an accuracy of 93% in predicting customer satisfaction.

**Skills:** Natural Language Processing, Naive Bayes Classifiers, Count Vectorizer, Text Processing

### [Behavior Driven Subscriptions](https://github.com/adilsaid64/behavior-driven-subscriptions)

The project aimed to increase paid membership by identifying customers less likely to enroll and offering them targeted incentives.

**Results:** Built a predictive model using logistic regression, analyzing customer data, and determining key features impacting conversion.

**Skills:** Data analysis, Predictive modeling, Statistical analysis, Business strategy, Problem-solving, Data preprocessing, Feature engineering and Data visualization

### [Movie Ratings](https://github.com/adilsaid64/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20for%20Machine%20Learning%20&%20Data%20Science%20Masterclass/Movie%20Rating)

An EDA Project. How much can you trust the ratings shown on a movie online? Especially when the same company showing the ratings makes money from selling tickets? Is there a conflict of intrest for companies selling movie tickets and displaying movie ratings?

**Result:** Found out that the company was over rating movies.
 
**Skills:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Problem Solving, Visulisation, Python Pandas and Seaborn

### [Breast Cancer Classification](https://github.com/adilsaid64/breast-cancer-classification)

Used a Support Vector Machine Classifier to classify cancer cells as Malignant or Benign.

**Result:** Built a model that achieves 97% accuracy.

**Skills:** Machine Learning, Model Evaluation, Optimization, Classification


### [Ecommerce Data](https://github.com/adilsaid64/ecommerce-data)

Should the company focus its resources on improving its application or website?

**Result:** Built a Linear Regression Model to help a business make a decision on where to direct its resources.

**Skills:** EDA, Linear Regression, Project Planning, Data Visualization
