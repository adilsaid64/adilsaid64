[![LeetCode](https://img.shields.io/badge/LeetCode-%23FFA116.svg?&style=flat-square&logo=leetcode&logoColor=white)](https://leetcode.com/adilsaid64/)


I am an enthusiastic Data Scienctist with a pasion for Mathematics, Statistic and Machine Learning. I am constantly engaging in real-life projects to develop practical skills, expose my self to new theoretical statistics concepts and gain valuable experiences. My passion lies in leveraging the knowledge I acquire to solve a wide range of problems and provide data-driven solutions in any context.

With a BSc H degree in Mathematics and having successfully completed over five distinct projects, I have developed skills and gained experience that I confidently apply as a Data Scientist. My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge and making a meaningful impact through data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Projects

### [British Airways Project](https://github.com/adilsaid64/british-airways-project)

This project was completed during a virtual internship with British Airways. The first task involved scraping customer review data to uncover valuable insights into customer preferences, satisfaction levels, and their overall experience with the company's services. The second task involved building a predictive model to determine whether customers would make a purchase and gain an understanding of the factors that influence buying behavior.

**Results**: Using the BeautifulSoup library, I successfully scraped customer review data. I performed time series analysis to discover that ratings have been declining. Additionally, I examined the distribution of ratings across different classes and conducted sentiment analysis on the reviews provided by customers. Furthermore, I employed a random forest classifier to predict whether customers would make a purchase and identified the factors that influence their purchasing decisions.

**Skills**: Data Scraping, Time Series Analysis, Data Visualization, Sentiment Analysis, Machine Learning, Classification, Predictive Modeling, Insight Extraction, Exploratory Data Analysis

### [Predicting Customer Satisfaction from Yelp Reviews using NLP](https://github.com/adilsaid64/yelp-reviews)

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether customers are satisfied or not based on the reviews they have written.

**Results:** Learned the basics of Natural Language Processing, applied Count Vectorizer, and utilized Naive Bayes classifiers. The model achieved an accuracy of 93% in predicting customer satisfaction.

**Skills:** Natural Language Processing, Naive Bayes Classifiers, Count Vectorizer, Text Processing

### [Behavior Driven Subscriptions](https://github.com/adilsaid64/behavior-driven-subscriptions)

The project aimed to increase paid membership by identifying customers less likely to enroll and offering them targeted incentives.

**Results:** Built a predictive model using logistic regression, analyzing customer data, and determining key features impacting conversion.

**Skills:** Data analysis, Predictive modeling, Statistical analysis, Business strategy, Problem-solving, Data preprocessing, Feature engineering and Data visualization

### [Movie Ratings](https://github.com/adilsaid64/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20for%20Machine%20Learning%20&%20Data%20Science%20Masterclass/Movie%20Rating)

An EDA Project. How much can you trust the ratings shown on a movie online? Especially when the same company showing the ratings makes money from selling tickets? Is there a conflict of intrest for companies selling movie tickets and displaying movie ratings?

**Result:** Found out that the company was over rating movies.
 
**Skills:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Problem Solving, Visulisation, Python Pandas and Seaborn

### [Breast Cancer Classification](https://github.com/adilsaid64/breast-cancer-classification)

Used a Support Vector Machine Classifier to classify cancer cells as Malignant or Benign.

**Result:** Built a model that achieves 97% accuracy.

**Skills:** Machine Learning, Model Evaluation, Optimization, Classification


### [Ecommerce Data](https://github.com/adilsaid64/ecommerce-data)

Should the company focus its resources on improving its application or website?

**Result:** Built a Linear Regression Model to help a business make a decision on where to direct its resources.

**Skills:** EDA, Linear Regression, Project Planning, Data Visualization
