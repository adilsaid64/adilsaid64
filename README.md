I am constantly doing new real-life and applicable Data Science and Machine Learning projects to build skills and experiences. I want to use what I learn to help solve a range of problems, add value and find data led solutions anywhere I am. 

So far have completed over five different projects and a BSc H in Mathematics, from which I have gained a diverse set of applicable skills, knowledge and experience that I can use confidently as a Data Scientist.
